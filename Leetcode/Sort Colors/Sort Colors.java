// Given an array nums with n objects colored red, white, or blue, sort them in-place so that objects of the same color are adjacent,
//  with the colors in the order red, white, and blue.
// We will use the integers 0, 1, and 2 to represent the color red, white, and blue, respectively.

/*
Approach:
partition the array into 3 parts, 0,1,2 instead of just 2 parts like quick sort. We just put 0 on the left side, 2 on the right side.
we have two pointers low and high which indicate the bound of 0s and 2s (low is the right bound of 0 and high is the left bound of 2). 


During the partition,left side of low pointer will be all 0s and right side of high pointer will be all 2s. 
swaping nums[mid] with the number[low + 1] when nums[mid] == 0 and with number[high - 1] when nums[mid] == 2ã€‚
